# To-Do: Basic Application

This project shows you how to create a simple Angular 2 ToDo application.

## Dependencies

Before you get started, you need to make sure you have node.js installed. We'll be using `npm` to run this project (`npm` will be installed when you install node.js). You can [install node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Installing

First, you need to make sure you install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then we will put it on dev

- compile our TypeScript code and
- host the app on local development server

by running the command:

```
npm run do-dev
```

We may also build it for prod

- compile our TypeScript code and
- minify the javascript
- host the app on local development server

by running the command:

```
npm run do-prod
```


Then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You should see some dummy tasks.

## Getting Help

In the case where it doesn't work, the first thing to try is looking at the developer console in your browser.

If that doesn't work, give me a shout @ cyrilcherian@gmail.com!
